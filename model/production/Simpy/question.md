Medium TV 30
Large TV 40
Flat screen TV 20
Pallets
Number of pallets 30
OP10
Cycle time Normal (mean = 1.9, SD = 0.19)
OP20
Cycle time 2.1
Breakdowns:
Time between failure Negative exponential (mean = 300)
Repair time Triangular (min = 5, mode = 25,
max = 60)
Set-ups on changeover of TV type:
Set-up time Normal (mean = 5.0, SD = 0.5)
OP30
Cycle time 2.0
Breakdowns:
Time between failure Negative exponential (mean = 450)
Repair time Erlang (mean = 35, k = 3)
Set-ups on changeover of TV type:
Set-up time Normal (mean = 5.0, SD = 0.5)
OP40
Cycle time 2.0 per station
5 stations
Test
Cycle time 1.5
Breakdowns:
Time between failure Negative exponential (mean = 250)
Repair time Since the data gives a bimodal
distribution, an empirical distribution
is used:
Repair time Frequency
0.0–10.0 10
10.0–20.0 25
20.0–30.0 20
30.0–40.0 7
40.0–50.0 5
50.0–60.0 17
60.0–70.0 14
Set-ups on changeover of TV type:
Set-up time Normal (mean = 3.0, SD = 0.3)
OP50
Cycle time 2.1
Breakdowns:
Time between failure Negative exponential (mean = 370)
Repair time Triangular (min = 10, mode = 30,
max = 80)
Set-ups on changeover:
Set-up time Normal (mean = 5.0, SD = 0.5)
OP60
Cycle time Normal (mean = 1.9, SD = 0.19)
